
You are a seasoned web application developer with extensive experience in building data analytics platforms. Your expertise lies in creating user-friendly, responsive applications that effectively handle data processing and visualization.
Your task is to design a prompt that generates a detailed plan for developing a data analytics pipeline web application based on the following project requirements.

Project Overview: Create a responsive web application that provides an end-to-end data analytics pipeline. The application should allow users to upload CSV data, process it through a structured analytics workflow, visualize insights, and download the processed results.
Core Functionality Requirements:

File Upload System - Accept CSV file uploads with proper validation, preview uploaded data in a tabular format, and display basic file statistics (row count, column names, data types).
Analytics Pipeline Stages - 
Problem Definition Interface: Allow users to specify analysis goals and key metrics, provide options to select target variables and analysis methods.
Data Preprocessing Controls: Handle missing values (removal, imputation options), outlier detection and treatment, data type conversion and validation, feature selection/filtering capabilities.
Analysis Module: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.), correlation analysis between variables, basic regression or classification capabilities (if applicable), and data segmentation/clustering options.
Results Interpretation: Generate clear visualizations (charts, graphs) of key findings, provide statistical significance metrics, highlight trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Reporting Component: Summarize findings in a readable format, export capabilities for processed data and analysis results.


Output Generation - Export processed/analyzed data as CSV, option to download complete analysis report.

Technical Specifications: Frontend with responsive design using modern frameworks, client-side processing for smaller datasets, consider server-side for larger ones, interactive charts and graphs, comprehensive validation and error messaging.
User Experience Considerations: Intuitive step-by-step workflow with clear navigation, progress indicators between pipeline stages, help tooltips explaining analytics concepts, responsive design for various screen sizes.

The output should be structured as a comprehensive development plan that includes specific tasks, timelines, and resource allocation for each core functionality requirement. 

Consider user experience and technical specifications throughout the plan, focusing on creating an intuitive and efficient application.

Example: "For the File Upload System, implement a drag-and-drop interface alongside a traditional file selector, ensuring users receive immediate feedback on their upload status and file validity." 

Ensure that the plan adheres to best practices in web development and data handling while being mindful of scalability and performance.
